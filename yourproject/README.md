## Installation

Before running this project, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that will allow you to run the landing page locally, and Yarn is a package manager that will help you install all of the necessary dependencies.

After you've installed Node.js and Yarn, you can clone the repository and install its dependencies:

```bash
cd your-project-foldername
yarn install
```

If you prefer to use npm, the default package manager that comes with Node.js, you can replace `yarn install` with `npm install`.

## How to Run

Once you've installed the necessary dependencies, you can run the landing page with the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

If you're using npm, you can use the following command instead:

```bash
npm start
```

After running this command, you should be able to see the landing page by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.
